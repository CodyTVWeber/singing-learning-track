    content: `Welcome to your first singing lesson! I'm Kooka, and I'll teach you the secret of great singing.

**Kooka's Breathing Technique:**

**Exercise 1: The Kookaburra Belly**
- Place your wings (hands) on your belly
- Breathe in slowly like you're filling up with air to sing your beautiful laugh
- Your belly should expand like Kooka's when she takes a big breath
- Breathe out slowly with a gentle "hoo" sound

**Exercise 2: The Eucalyptus Leaf Float**
- Imagine holding a eucalyptus leaf in front of you
- Breathe in, then blow gently to keep the leaf floating
- This teaches you breath control!

**Why This Matters:**
Just like Kooka needs good breath control for her famous laugh, singers need it for beautiful notes!

Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!"

- "Twinkle, twinkle" - these notes are the same
- "little star" - this goes down like walking down stairs  
- "How I wonder" - goes up like climbing up
- "what you are" - comes back down to home

**Song 2: Mary Had a Little Lamb**
"Mary had a little lamb,
Little lamb, little lamb,
Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow!"

**Kooka's Tips:**
- This song mostly stays on the same notes

- Practice slowly first, then speed up!

**Your Challenge:**
Sing both songs with Kooka! Focus on:
- Breathing between phrases (like Kooka taught you)
- Matching the pitch (high and low in the right places)
- Having fun - let your personality shine!

    content: `Kooka is excited to teach you about dynamics - that's the fancy word for loud and soft!

**Kooka's Volume Control:**

**Exercise 1: The Whisper Game**
- Sing "Hoo" very quietly, like telling Kooka a secret
- So soft that only someone very close could hear
- This is called "pianissimo" (very soft)

**Exercise 2: Normal Conversation**
- Sing "Hoo" like you're talking to Kooka normally
- Not too loud, not too soft - just comfortable
- This is called "mezzo" (medium)

**Exercise 3: Calling Across the Forest**
- Sing "Hoo" like you're calling to Kooka in the next tree
- Loud and clear, but don't shout or strain
- This is called "forte" (loud)

**Exercise 4: The Volume Roller Coaster**
- Start soft: "Hoooo..." (pianissimo)
- Get louder: "Hoooo..." (mezzo)  
- End loud: "HOOOO!" (forte)
- Then back down: loud ‚Üí medium ‚Üí soft

**Song Practice:**
Sing "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" with dynamics:
- "Twinkle, twinkle" (soft - like a gentle star)
- "little star" (medium)
- "How I wonder what you are" (getting louder with excitement)
- "Up above the world so high" (loud - amazed!)
- Back to soft for the rest
