# Kooka Sing - User Flow Tests Status

## ✅ Tests Created Successfully

I have created comprehensive user flow tests for the Kooka Sing Flutter application. The tests are syntactically correct and properly structured, but **they have not been executed** because Flutter is not installed in the current environment.

## 📁 Files Created

### Test Files
1. **test/user_flows/splash_navigation_test.dart** - Tests splash screen navigation logic
2. **test/user_flows/onboarding_flow_test.dart** - Tests user onboarding process  
3. **test/user_flows/skill_tree_flow_test.dart** - Tests skill tree display and interaction
4. **test/integration_test/complete_user_journey_test.dart** - End-to-end user journey tests

### Test Utilities
1. **test/test_helpers/mock_storage.dart** - Mock storage implementations
2. **test/test_helpers/test_data.dart** - Test data factory methods
3. **test/test_helpers/test_setup.dart** - Hive test environment setup

### Documentation & Scripts
1. **test/README.md** - Test structure overview
2. **test/TESTING_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive testing guide
3. **run_user_flow_tests.sh** - Shell script to run all tests
4. **.github/workflows/user_flow_tests.yml** - CI/CD workflow
5. **TEST_STATUS.md** - This status document

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Tests Not Executed
The tests have been created but **not run** due to Flutter not being available in the environment. When you run them in an environment with Flutter installed, you may encounter:

1. **Hive Initialization Issues**: The tests use Hive for persistence. The test setup includes proper Hive initialization for tests, but this needs to be verified in a real Flutter environment.

2. **Widget Finding Issues**: Some widget text or structure might differ slightly from what's expected in the tests. I've fixed the obvious ones I could find, but there may be more.

3. **Async Timing Issues**: The tests use `pumpAndSettle()` and specific duration pumps. These might need adjustment based on actual animation durations.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

During creation, I identified and fixed several issues:

1. ✅ Changed `UserStore.clearUser()` to `UserStore.clearAll()` to match actual API
2. ✅ Updated splash screen text expectations from "Your Journey with Kooka" to "Kooka Sing"
3. ✅ Fixed onboarding welcome text to match actual UI
4. ✅ Added proper Hive test setup with temporary directories
5. ✅ Added missing UserProfile import in integration tests

## 🚀 How to Run the Tests

When Flutter is available, run:

```bash
# Install dependencies first
flutter pub get

# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test suite
flutter test test/user_flows/splash_navigation_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Use the provided script
./run_user_flow_tests.sh
```

## 🔍 Expected Test Results

Based on the code analysis, the tests should:

### Likely to Pass ✅
- Basic widget finding tests
- Navigation flow tests (with possible timing adjustments)
- UI element presence tests

### May Need Adjustments ⚠️
- Exact text matching (if UI text has changed)
- Animation timing (may need to adjust pump durations)
- Hive initialization (may need additional setup)
- Mock method channel for path_provider

## 📝 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Run the tests** in a Flutter environment
2. **Fix any failures** by adjusting:
   - Text expectations to match actual UI
   - Timing for animations
   - Widget finder strategies
3. **Add more test cases** for:
   - Lesson page (when implemented)
   - Audio features (when implemented)
   - Error scenarios
4. **Set up CI/CD** using the provided GitHub Actions workflow
5. **Monitor test coverage** and aim for >80% coverage

## 🎯 Test Coverage Summary

The created tests cover:

- **33 test cases** across 4 test files
- **3 main user flows**: Splash → Onboarding → Skill Tree
- **Key features**: Navigation, form validation, data persistence, UI rendering
- **Edge cases**: New vs returning users, error handling, empty states

## 💡 Tips for Running Tests

1. If tests fail with "Storage not initialized", ensure the test setup is called properly
2. If widgets aren't found, use `flutter inspector` to verify actual widget tree
3. For flaky tests, increase timeouts or use `pumpAndSettle()` more liberally
4. Run tests in `--verbose` mode for detailed output when debugging

The tests are ready to be executed once Flutter is available in your environment!
