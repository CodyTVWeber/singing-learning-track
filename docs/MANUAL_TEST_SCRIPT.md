### B. Next Day Streak Increment (simulate)
To simulate the next day without waiting:
1. Open DevTools > Application > Local Storage > `kooka_sing_user`
2. Edit the JSON value for `lastStreakDate` to yesterday's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. Refresh the app
4. Complete any lesson
5. Verify the streak chip shows "2 days ðŸ”¥"
6. Verify a `streak_incremented` analytics event fired with `{ streakCount: 2 }`

### C. Same-Day Multiple Completions
