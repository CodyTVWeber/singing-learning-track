# Kooka Sing - Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the ROO Code Boomerang tasks for the Kookaburra-themed Flutter singing learning app.

## Completed Milestones 

### ✅ WS1: Data & Models (COMPLETED)
**Requirements**: Define core types and sample data
**Output**: 
- ✅ `lib/models/lesson.dart` - Hive-serialized Lesson model
- ✅ `lib/models/user.dart` - UserProfile model with copyWith
- ✅ `lib/models/progress.dart` - LessonProgress model with copyWith  
- ✅ `lib/data/units.dart` - Sample lessons and utility functions
**Outcome**: Other streams can consume stable APIs for lessons and progress

**Contracts Implemented**:
- ✅ `List<Lesson> getLessonsByUnit(int unit)`
- ✅ `Lesson? getLessonById(String id)`
- ✅ `bool isLessonUnlocked(String id, List<String> completed)`

### ✅ WS2: Skill Tree UI (COMPLETED)
**Requirements**: Display units/lessons, lock/unlock states
**Output**: 
- ✅ `lib/pages/skill_tree_page.dart` - Interactive skill tree with real data
**Outcome**: Users see current path and what unlocks next
- ✅ Unit and lesson cards render with proper Kookaburra theme
- ✅ Locked vs unlocked vs completed styles implemented
- ✅ Integration with user storage for progress tracking

### ✅ WS3: Onboarding & Persistence (COMPLETED)  
**Requirements**: Onboarding (name, age), local storage via Hive
**Output**:
- ✅ `lib/pages/onboarding_page.dart` - Beautiful onboarding flow
- ✅ `lib/pages/splash_page.dart` - App initialization and routing
- ✅ `lib/storage/user_store.dart` - User persistence with Hive
- ✅ `lib/storage/progress_store.dart` - Progress persistence with Hive
**Outcome**: Returning users skip onboarding; state persists

**Contracts Implemented**:
- ✅ `Future<UserProfile?> getUser()`
- ✅ `Future<void> saveUser(UserProfile user)`
- ✅ `Future<List<LessonProgress>> getProgress(String userId)`
- ✅ `Future<void> saveProgress(LessonProgress p)`

## Infrastructure Completed

### ✅ Project Setup
- ✅ Flutter dependencies added (Hive, path_provider, uuid)
- ✅ Kookaburra assets configured in pubspec.yaml
- ✅ Hive code generation setup and working
- ✅ Beautiful Kookaburra-themed color scheme in AppTheme
- ✅ Fixed test file to work with new app structure

### ✅ Navigation & Flow
- ✅ Splash screen with Kookaburra branding and initialization
- ✅ Onboarding flow with name/age group collection
- ✅ Seamless navigation to skill tree after setup
- ✅ Proper error handling throughout

### ✅ Kookaburra Theme Integration
- ✅ Warm browns and earth tones matching kookaburra plumage
- ✅ Beautiful splash screen with kookaburra image
- ✅ Friendly onboarding with kookaburra companion
- ✅ Personalized greeting in skill tree ("Hi [Name]!")
- ✅ Points display in app bar

## Current Milestone Status (M1 - 0.1.0)

**M1 Requirements**: Foundation, theme, models, skill tree read-only
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Compiling app with beautiful Kookaburra theme
- ✅ Skill tree rendering from real persisted data
- ✅ User onboarding working
- ✅ Local persistence with Hive
- ✅ Proper navigation flow

**Acceptance**: ✅ App runs successfully on macOS; navigation works; data persists

## Next Steps (M2 - WS4: Lesson Flow)

### 🔄 WS4: Lesson Flow (PENDING)
**Requirements**: Intro → practice → completion; unlock next lesson
**Output**: `lib/pages/lesson_page.dart`, reusable lesson widgets  
**Outcome**: Completing a lesson updates points/streak and unlocks next

**Pending Tasks**:
- [ ] Create lesson page with intro screen
- [ ] Implement practice interface  
- [ ] Add completion screen with celebration
- [ ] Wire up progress saving and point updates
- [ ] Create reusable UI widgets (Kooka mascot, buttons)

## Architecture Notes

### On-Device First Design
- ✅ All data stored locally with Hive (no server dependencies)
- ✅ User profiles and progress persist across app restarts
- ✅ Sample lessons built into the app
- ✅ Ready for offline-first audio features in later milestones

### Scalability for Future Milestones
- ✅ Storage abstraction ready for M4 audio features
- ✅ Model structure supports lesson content expansion
- ✅ Theme system ready for animations (deferred to M5+)
- ✅ User progress tracking ready for streaks and achievements

### Code Quality  
- ✅ Flutter analyze passes with no errors
- ✅ Proper error handling and loading states
- ✅ Consistent naming and file organization
- ✅ Type-safe Hive serialization
- ✅ Responsive UI design principles

## Demo Path Status
1. ✅ Fresh install → Splash → Onboarding → Skill tree shows Unit 1
2. 🔄 Start first lesson → practice → complete → points awarded (Next milestone)
3. 🔄 Next lesson unlocks via gating → unit completion visible (Next milestone) 
4. ⏳ Practice uses audio (M4 milestone)

**Current State**: M1 (0.1.0) is complete and shippable. Ready to begin M2 (WS4: Lesson Flow).
