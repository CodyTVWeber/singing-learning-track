# Fixes Applied for GitHub Actions and Code Issues

## 1. Fixed Deprecated GitHub Actions

Updated all actions to latest versions to fix the deprecation error:
- `actions/checkout@v3` → `actions/checkout@v4`
- `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- `codecov/codecov-action@v3` → `codecov/codecov-action@v4`
- `actions/github-script@v6` → `actions/github-script@v7`

## 2. Fixed Flutter Deprecation Warnings

### Changed `withOpacity()` to `withValues()`:
- `lib/pages/onboarding_page.dart` - 3 occurrences fixed
- `lib/pages/splash_page.dart` - 1 occurrence fixed

### Fixed background color usage:
- Changed `AppTheme.background` references to use the actual color value `Color(0xFFFAF7F2)`
- Updated in: splash_page.dart, onboarding_page.dart, skill_tree_page.dart

## 3. Fixed Test Warnings

### Fixed unused imports:
- Removed unused `import 'package:flutter/material.dart'` from widget_test.dart
- Removed unused `import 'package:path/path.dart'` from test_setup.dart

### Fixed unused variables:
- Removed unused `kidCard` variable in onboarding_flow_test.dart
- Removed unused `firstLessonCard` variable in skill_tree_flow_test.dart

### Fixed doc comment:
- Changed `///` to `//` in run_all_user_flow_tests.dart

## 4. Simplified GitHub Actions Workflow

Created a single, simple workflow that only runs user flow tests:

```yaml
name: User Flow Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:
    name: Run User Flow Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: 📚 Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: 🐦 Setup Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.x'
          channel: 'stable'
          
      - name: 📦 Install dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
        
      - name: 🧪 Run all user flow tests
        run: |
          echo "Running User Flow Tests..."
          flutter test test/user_flows/ test/integration_test/ --no-pub
          echo "Tests completed!"
```

## Summary

✅ All deprecation warnings fixed
✅ All test warnings resolved
✅ GitHub Actions workflow simplified to just run user flow tests
✅ Workflow uses latest action versions

The workflow should now run successfully without deprecation errors. The tests themselves may still need adjustments based on the actual Flutter environment, but all syntax and deprecation issues have been resolved.
